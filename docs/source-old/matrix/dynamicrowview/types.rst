.. _dynamicrowview_scalar_type:
.. cpp:type:: scalar_type = Scalar

   The type of the entries in the matrix.

.. _dynamicrowview_scalar_reference:
.. cpp:type:: scalar_reference = Scalar&

   The type of references to the entries in the matrix (might not be
   :code:`Scalar&`).

.. _dynamicrowview_scalar_const_reference:
.. cpp:type:: scalar_const_reference = Scalar const&

   The type of references to the entries in the matrix (might not be
   :code:`Scalar const&`).

.. _dynamicrowview_mat_type:
.. cpp:type:: matrix_type = DynamicMatrix

   The type of the matrix underlying a :cpp:any:`DynamicRowView`.

.. _dynamicrowview_row_type:
.. cpp:type:: Row = Mat::Row

   The type of a row of a DynamicRowView.

.. _dynamicrowview_iterator:
.. cpp:type:: iterator = Mat::iterator
