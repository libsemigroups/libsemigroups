=========

.. cpp:namespace:: libsemigroups::StaticRowView<PlusOp, ProdOp, ZeroOp, OneOp, C, Scalar>

.. cpp:function:: Row operator+(StaticRowView const& that)

   Sums a row view with another row view and returns a newly allocated Row.

   :param that: the row view to add to ``this``.

   :returns: A value of type :cpp:any:`Row`

   :throws:
      If the implementation of the semiring addition throws or
      ``std::bad_alloc`` is thrown.

   :complexity:
      :math:`O(m)` where :math:`m` is :cpp:any:`size`

   .. warning::
      The two row views must be of the same size, although this is not
      verified by the implementation.
