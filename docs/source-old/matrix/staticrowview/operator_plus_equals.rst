.. cpp:namespace:: libsemigroups::StaticRowView<PlusOp, ProdOp, ZeroOp, OneOp, C, Scalar>

.. cpp:function:: void operator+=(StaticRowView const& that)

   Sums a row view with another row view in-place.
   Redefines ``this`` to be the sum of ``*this`` and ``that``.

   :param that: the row view to add to ``this``.

   :returns: (None)

   :throws:
      If the implementation of the semiring addition throws.

   :complexity:
      :math:`O(m)` where :math:`m` is :cpp:any:`size`

   .. warning::
      The two row views must be of the same size, although this is not
      verified by the implementation.


.. cpp:function:: void operator+=(scalar_type const a)

   Adds a scalar to every entry of the row in-place.

   :param a: the scalar to add to ``this``.

   :returns: (None)

   :complexity:
      :math:`O(m)` where :math:`m` is :cpp:any:`size`

   :throws:
      If the implementation of the semiring addition throws.
