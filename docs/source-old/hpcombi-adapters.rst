HPCombi adapters
================

This page contains the documentation of the functionality in ``libsemigroups``
that adapts the types in HPCombi_ for use with the algorithms in
``libsemigroups``.  The functionality in this section is only available if
``libsemigroups`` is compiled with HPCombi_ support enabled; this is only
possible on certain computer architectures. See `the installation instructions
<install.html>`_ and the HPCombi_ documentation for further details.
