This file contains documentation for the functionality in `libsemigroups`
related to congruences of semigroups and monoids. The following classes are implemented in `libsemigroups`:

- \ref libsemigroups::SimsSettings "SimsSettings" - for setting the presentation and various runtime parameters of the Sims low index algorithm.
- \ref libsemigroups::Sims1 "Sims1" - for computing finite index right congruences of a finitely presented semigroup or monoid.
- \ref libsemigroups::Sims2 "Sims2" - for computing finite index two-sided congruences of a finitely presented semigroup or monoid.
- \ref libsemigroups::RepOrc "RepOrc" - for computing small degree transformation representations of a finite semigroup or monoid.
- \ref libsemigroups::MinimalRepOrc "MinimalRepOrc" - for computing the minimal degree of a transformation representation arising from a right congruences of a finite semigroup or monoid.
- \ref libsemigroups::SimsStats "SimsStats" - for keeping track of various statistics arising during the runtime of the low index algorithm.
