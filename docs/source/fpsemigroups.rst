Finitely presented semigroups 
=============================

``libsemigroups`` implements several algorithms for computing finitely
presented semigroups and monoids. The main algorithms implemented are
Todd-Coxeter, Knuth-Bendix, algorithms for C(4) small overlap monoids (by
Kambites and Tsalakou), and brute-force enumeration; see the links below for
further details. As a convenience, ``libsemigroups`` also has a class
:cpp:type:`libsemigroups::FpSemigroup` that runs some predetermined variants of
Todd-Coxeter, Knuth-Bendix, and the brute-force enumeration in parallel.  This
class is, at present, not very customisable, and lacks some of the fine grained
control offered by the classes implementing individual algorithms, such as
:cpp:type:`libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::ToddCoxeter` and
:cpp:type:`libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::KnuthBendix`.  

All of the classes for finitely presented semigroups and monoids in
``libsemigroups`` can be used "interactively", in the sense that they can be
run for a particular amount of time, or until some condition is met; for
further details see, for example,
:cpp:func:`libsemigroups::Runner::run_for` and
:cpp:func:`libsemigroups::Runner::run_until`.

The classes in ``libsemigroups`` for finitely presented semigroups
and monoids are:
