Changelog
=========

v1.0.5 (released 13/01/2020)

This is a minor release with some minor changes to the documentation and build
system. The non-trivial changes in this release were made by `Isuru Fernando`_

v1.0.4 (released 11/01/2020)
----------------------------

This is a minor release with several improvements to the build system. It is
now possible to build ``libsemigroups`` using an external installation of ``fmt`` 
with the configure option ``--with-external-fmt``, and it should also be
possible to build ``libsemigroups`` on non-x86 architectures.

v1.0.3 (released 07/12/2019)
----------------------------

This is a minor release that includes some fixes that caused tests to fail on
32-bit systems. The non-trivial changes in this release were made by 
`J.  James`_

v1.0.2 (released 30/11/2019)
----------------------------

This is a very minor release to fix a bad test that failed in the conda package
continuous integration.

v1.0.1 (released 29/11/2019)
----------------------------

This is a minor release to resolve some issues with the conda package, and to
remove some compiler warnings.

v1.0.0 (released 27/11/2019)
----------------------------

This is a major release that dramatically expands the scope of
``libsemigroups``.  In v1.0.0, ``libsemigroups`` has been almost completely
rewritten, generalised, and some new features have been added.
