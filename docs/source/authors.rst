- `R. Cirpons`_ contributed to ``IsObviouslyInfinite``, to integrating
  ``eigen``, and contributed an implementation of the Radoszewski-Rytter
  algorithm for testing equivalence of words in free bands.
- `F. Hivert`_ contributed many helpful ideas to ``libsemigroups``, an
  allocator implementation (to be included in a future version), and
  ``HPCombi``.
- `J. James`_ contributed some bugfixes.
- `J. Jonušas`_ contributed to the implementation of the Froidure-Pin algorithm.
- `D. V. Pasechnik`_ contributed to the build system.
- `F. Smith`_ contributed the implementation of the Konieczny and
  Lallement-McFadden algorithm, to the Todd-Coxeter implementation, and to
  BMat8s.
- `N. Thiery`_ contributed to the build system, packaging ``libsemigroups`` via
  conda, the python bindings and many helpful conversations and suggestions. 
- `M. Torpey`_ contributed to the congruences code in the v0.0.1 to v0.6.7.
- `M. Tsalakou`_ contributed to the Knuth-Bendix implementation, related
  algorithms for the class :cpp:any:`ActionDigraph`, and to the implementation
  of the :cpp:any:`Kambites` class.
