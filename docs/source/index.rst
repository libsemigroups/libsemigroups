libsemigroups - Version 2.0.0
=============================

C++ library for semigroups and monoids
--------------------------------------

What is ``libsemigroups``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libsemigroups``  is a C++14 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups. 
Namely:

- the `Froidure-Pin algorithm`_ for computing finite semigroups
  :cite:`Froidure1997aa`;
- the `Todd-Coxeter algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Knuth-Bendix algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Schreier-Sims algorithm`_ for permutation groups;
- a preliminary implementation of the `Konieczny`_ :cite:`Konieczny1994aa` and
  `Lallement-McFadden`_ :cite:`Lallement1990aa` algorithm for computing finite
  semigroups which act on sets;
- an implementation of the `Radoszewski-Rytter`_ :cite:`Radoszewski2010aa`
  algorithm for testing equivalence of words in free bands.
- an implementation of the algorithm for solving the word problem
  for small overlap monoids, and for computing normal forms in such monoids;

The development version of ``libsemigroups`` is available on github_, and some related projects are here_.

The main classes in ``libsemigroups`` are named after the algorithms they
implement; see, for example,  :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::FroidurePin`,
:cpp:any:`libsemigroups::Konieczny`,
:cpp:any:`libsemigroups::congruence::ToddCoxeter`,
:cpp:any:`libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::KnuthBendix`, and
:cpp:any:`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`.

The implementations in :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::FroidurePin`,
:cpp:any:`libsemigroups::Konieczny`, and :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`
are generic and easily adapted to user-defined types.

``libsemigroups`` uses: `HPCombi`_ which uses the SSE and AVX instruction sets
for very fast manipulation of transformations, partial permutations,
permutations, and boolean matrices of small size;  `catch`_ for tests; 
`fmt`_ for reporting; and `eigen`_ for some linear algebra computations.

   changelog

``libsemigroups`` is used in the `Semigroups package for GAP`_, and the
development version is available on github_. There were `python bindings`_
(for Python 2 and 3) for earlier versions of ``libsemigroups``, and there will
be in the future too, but presently they don't work.
