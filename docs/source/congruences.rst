Congruences
===========

.. cpp:namespace:: libsemigroups

``libsemigroups`` implements serveral algorithms for computing a congruence of
a semigroup or monoid. The main algorithms implemented are Todd-Coxeter,
Knuth-Bendix, algorithms for C(4) small overlap monoids (by Kambites and
Tsalakou),and brute-force enumeration; see the links below for further details.
As a convenience, ``libsemigroups`` also has a class
:cpp:type:`libsemigroups::Congruence` that runs some predetermined variants of
Todd-Coxeter, Knuth-Bendix, the small overlap algorithms, and the brute-force
enumeration in parallel.  This class is, at present, not very customisable, and
lacks some of the fine grained control offered by the classes implementing
individual algorithms, such as :cpp:type:`congruence::ToddCoxeter`,
:cpp:type:`congruence::KnuthBendix`, and :cpp:type:`congruence::Kambites`.

All of the classes for congruences in ``libsemigroups`` can be used
"interactively", in the sense that they can be run for a particular amount of
time, or until some condition is met; for further details see, for example,
:cpp:func:`Runner::run_for` and
:cpp:func:`Runner::run_until`.

The "handedness" of a congruence is determined by:

.. doxygenenum:: libsemigroups::congruence_kind
   :project: libsemigroups

The classes in ``libsemigroups`` for congruences are:
