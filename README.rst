C++ library for semigroups and monoids
--------------------------------------

What is ``libsemigroups``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libsemigroups``  is a C++17 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite, and finitely presented, semigroups and
monoids. Namely:

- the `Froidure-Pin algorithm`_ for computing finite semigroups;
- the `Todd-Coxeter algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
  see also `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11148>`__;
- the `Knuth-Bendix algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Schreier-Sims algorithm`_ for permutation groups;
- a preliminary implementation of the `Konieczny`_ and
  `Lallement-McFadden`_ algorithm for computing finite
  semigroups which act on sets;
- an implementation of the `Radoszewski-Rytter`_
  algorithm for testing equivalence of words in free bands;
- an implementation of the algorithm for solving the word problem
  for small overlap monoids, and for computing normal forms in such monoids;
  see `Kambites <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2008.09.038>`__,
  `Kambites <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2008.12.028>`__, and
  `Mitchell-Tsalakou
  <http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12125>`__
- a version of Sims low index subgroup algorithm for computing one-sided
  congruences of a semigroup or monoid; see `this paper
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06295>`__ for details.
- a version of `Stephen's procedure`_ for finitely presented semigroups and
  monoids (for a given word :math:`w` this procedure is for determining words
  equivalent to :math:`w` or that are left divisors of :math:`w`).

``libsemigroups`` is partly based on `Algorithms for computing finite
semigroups`_, `Expository Slides`_, and `Semigroupe 2.01`_ by `Jean-Eric Pin`_.

.. _Algorithms for computing finite semigroups: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf
.. _Expository slides: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf
.. _Semigroupe 2.01: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html
.. _Jean-Eric Pin: https://www.irif.fr/~jep/

``libsemigroups`` is used in the `Semigroups package for GAP`_,  and it is
possible to use ``libsemigroups`` directly in Python 3 via the package
`libsemigroups_pybind11`_. The development version of ``libsemigroups`` is
available on github_, and some related projects are here_.

.. _github: https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups
.. _here: https://github.com/libsemigroups
.. _libsemigroups_pybind11: https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups_pybind11/
.. _Semigroups package for GAP: https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups

The main classes in ``libsemigroups`` are named after the algorithms they
implement; see, for example,  ``libsemigroups::FroidurePin``,
``libsemigroups::Konieczny``,
``libsemigroups::congruence::ToddCoxeter``,
``libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::Kambites``,
``libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::KnuthBendix``, and
``libsemigroups::SchreierSims``,
``libsemigroups::Sims1``, or
``libsemigroups::Stephen``.

The implementations in ``libsemigroups::FroidurePin``,
``libsemigroups::Konieczny``, and ``libsemigroups::SchreierSims``
are generic and easily adapted to user-defined types.

``libsemigroups`` uses: `HPCombi`_ which uses the SSE and AVX instruction sets
for very fast manipulation of transformations, partial permutations,
permutations, and boolean matrices of small size;  `catch`_ for tests;
`fmt`_ for reporting; and `eigen`_ for some linear algebra computations.
