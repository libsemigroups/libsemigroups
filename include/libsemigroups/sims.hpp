// This file contains a declaration of a class for performing the "low-index
// congruence" algorithm for 1-sided or 2-sided congruences of semigroups and
// monoids.

// TODO:
// * review the function aliases, and remove them if they are unnecessary
// * doc
// * iwyu
// * const
// * noexcept
// * nodiscard
// * python bindings
// * gap bindings

// TODO(later):
// * use Pruno in RepOrc + MinimalRepOrc
// * a version which allows specifying the word_graph to Sims1 too
// * implement maximum_2_sided_congruence_contained to compute the kernel of the
//   associated homomorphism, which is the largest 2-sided congruence contained
//   in the right congruence.
// * change RepOrc and MinimalRepOrc to compute minimal 2-sided congruences
//   first (by using generating pairs), and then to try and find a right
//   congruence not containing any of the minimal 2-sided congruences.
//
// TODO(far future):
// * Figure out a way of making refining functions possible. A refining function
// differs from a pruner in that it is also allowed to modify the word graph.
// * Implement one and two sided compatibility checking as refiners, following
// the theoretical description in the paper.
// * Modify SimsBase to perform the backtrack on all standard word graphs
// (without explicitly checking compatibility).
// * Make SimsBase -> Sims, i.e. implement all the relevant functions and
// settings of Sims1, Sims2, RepOrc, MinimalRepOrc into a single unified
// class.
// * Implement Sims1, Sim2, RepOrc, MinimalRepOrc just particular constructors
// of the Sims object, which automatically set the relevant pruners etc.
