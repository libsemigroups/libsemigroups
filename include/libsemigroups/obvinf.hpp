  //!
  //! \brief Functions for checking if a finitely presented semigroup or monoid
  //! is obviously infinite.
  //!
  //! This page collects the documentation for the functionality in
  //! `libsemigroups` for checking if a finitely presented semigroup or monoid
  //! is obviously infinite.

  //! \ingroup obvinf_group
  //!
  //! \brief Class for checking if a finitely presented semigroup or monoid is
  //! obviously infinite.
  //!
  //! This class implements a number of checks whether or not a finitely
  //! presented semigroup or monoid is infinite. These checks are all decidable,
  //! and always return an answer within an amount of time that is linear in the
  //! size of the input.
  //!
  //! These checks are:
  //!
  //!  1. For every generator there is at least one side of one relation that
  //!     consists solely of that generator. If this condition is not met, then
  //!     there is a generator of infinite order.
  //!
  //!  2. The number of occurrences of every generator is not preserved by the
  //!     relations. Otherwise, it is not possible to use the relations to
  //!     reduce the number of occurrences of a generator in a word, and so
  //!     there are infinitely many distinct words.
  //!
  //!  3. The number of generators on the left hand side of a relation is not
  //!     the same as the number of generators on the right hand side for at
  //!     least one generator. Otherwise the relations preserve the length of
  //!     any word and so there are infinitely many distinct words.
  //!
  //!  4. There are at least as many relations as there are generators.
  //!     Otherwise we can find a surjective homomorphism onto an infinite
  //!     subsemigroup of the rationals under addition.
  //!
  //!  5. The checks 2., 3. and 4. are a special case of a more general matrix
  //!     based condition. We construct a matrix whose columns correspond to
  //!     generators and rows correspond to relations. The (i, j)-th entry is
  //!     the number of occurrences of the j-th generator in the left hand side
  //!     of the i-th relation minus the number of occurrences of it on the
  //!     right hand side. If this matrix has a non-trivial kernel, then we can
  //!     construct a surjective homomorphism onto an infinite subsemigroup of
  //!     the rationals under addition. So we check that the matrix is full
  //!     rank.
  //!
  //!  6. The presentation is not that of a free product. To do this we consider
  //!     a graph whose vertices are generators and an edge connects two
  //!     generators if they occur on either side of the same relation. If this
  //!     graph is disconnected then the presentation is a free product and is
  //!     therefore infinite. Note that we currently do not consider the case
  //!     where the identity occurs in the presentation.
  //!
