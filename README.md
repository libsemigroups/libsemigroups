## What is libsemigroups?

`libsemigroups` is a C++14 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite, and finitely presented, semigroups and
monoids. Namely:

-   the [Froidure-Pin algorithm](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf)
    for computing finite semigroups;
-   the [Todd-Coxeter
    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%E2%80%93Coxeter_algorithm)
    for finitely presented semigroups and monoids; see also [this
    paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11148);
-   the [Knuth-Bendix
    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Bendix_completion_algorithm)
    for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
-   the [Schreier-Sims
    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm)
    for permutation groups;
-   a preliminary implementation of the
    [Konieczny](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02573672)
    and
    [Lallement-McFadden](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800570)
    algorithm for computing finite semigroups which act on sets;
-   an implementation of the
    [Radoszewski-Rytter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11266-9_55)
    algorithm for testing equivalence of words in free bands;
-   an implementation of the algorithm for solving the word problem for
    small overlap monoids, and for computing normal forms in such
    monoids; see
    [Kambites](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2008.09.038),
    [Kambites](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2008.12.028), and
    [Mitchell-Tsalakou](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12125)
-   a version of Sims low index subgroup algorithm for computing
    one-sided congruences of a semigroup or monoid; see [this
    paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06295) for details.
-   a version of [Stephen's procedure](https://rb.gy/brsuvc) for
    finitely presented semigroups and monoids (for a given word \\(w\\) this
    procedure is for determining words equivalent to $w$ or that are
    left divisors of $w$).

`libsemigroups` is partly based on [Algorithms for computing finite
semigroups](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf), [Expository
Slides](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf), and
[Semigroupe
2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html)
by [Jean-Eric Pin](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/).

`libsemigroups` is used in the [Semigroups package for
GAP](https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups), and it is possible to use
`libsemigroups` directly in Python 3 via the package
[libsemigroups_pybind11](https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups_pybind11/).
The development version of `libsemigroups` is available on
[github](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups), and some
related projects are [here](https://github.com/libsemigroups).

The main classes in `libsemigroups` are named after the algorithms they
implement; see, for example, `libsemigroups::FroidurePin`,
`libsemigroups::Konieczny`, `libsemigroups::congruence::ToddCoxeter`,
`libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::Kambites`,
`libsemigroups::fpsemigroup::KnuthBendix`, and
`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`, `libsemigroups::Sims1`, or
`libsemigroups::Stephen`.

The implementations in `libsemigroups::FroidurePin`,
`libsemigroups::Konieczny`, and `libsemigroups::SchreierSims` are
generic and easily adapted to user-defined types.

`libsemigroups` uses: [HPCombi](https://github.com/hivert/HPCombi) which
uses the SSE and AVX instruction sets for very fast manipulation of
transformations, partial permutations, permutations, and boolean
matrices of small size; [catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for
tests; [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for reporting; and
[eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for some linear algebra
computations.
