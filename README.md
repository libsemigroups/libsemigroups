## What is libsemigroups?

`libsemigroups` is a C++17 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite, and finitely presented, semigroups and
monoids. The main algorithms implemented in `libsemigroups` are:

- the [Froidure-Pin algorithm][] for computing semigroups and monoids defined
  by a generating set consisting of elements whose multiplication and equality is
  decidable (such as [transformations, partial permutations, permutations][],
  [bipartitions][], and [matrices over a semiring][]) in the
  [`libsemigroups::FroidurePin`][] class template;
- Kambites' algorithm for solving the word problem in small overlap monoids
  from ["Small overlap monoids I: The word problem"][], and the algorithm from
  ["An explicit algorithm for normal forms in small overlap monoids"][] in the
  class template [`libsemigroups::Kambites`][];
- the [Knuth-Bendix algorithm] for finitely presented semigroups and monoids
  in the class template [`libsemigroups::KnuthBendix`][];
- a version of Sims' low index subgroup algorithm for computing congruences of a
  semigroup or monoid from
  ["Computing finite index congruences of finitely presented semigroups and monoids"][]
  in the classes [`libsemigroups::Sims1`][] and [`libsemigroups::Sims2`][];
- a generalized version of the algorithms described in
  ["Green's equivalences in finite semigroups of binary relations"][] by
  Konieczny, and
  ["On the determination of Green's relations in finite transformation semigroups"][]
  by Lallement and Mcfadden for computing finite semigroups and monoids
  admitting a pair of actions with particular properties, in the class template
  [`libsemigroups::Konieczny`][];
- the algorithm from ["Efficient Testing of Equivalence of Words in a Free Idempotent Semigroup"][]
  by Radoszewski and Rytter in the function [`libsemigroups::freeband_equal_to`][];
- a non-random version of the [Schreier-Sims algorithm][]
  for permutation groups in the class template [`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`][];
- a version of Stephen's procedure from
  ["Applications of automata theory to presentations of monoids and inverse monoids"][]
  for finitely presented inverse semigroups and monoids (for a given word `w` this
  procedure is for determining words equivalent to `w` or that are
  left divisors of `w`) in the class template [`libsemigroups::Stephen`][];
- the [Todd-Coxeter algorithm][] for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
  in the class template [`libsemigroups::ToddCoxeter`][]; see also
  ["The Todd–Coxeter algorithm for semigroups and monoids"][].

`libsemigroups` is partly based on
[Algorithms for computing finite semigroups][Froidure-Pin algorithm],
[Expository Slides][], and [Semigroupe 2.01][] by [Jean-Eric Pin][].

`libsemigroups` is used in the [Semigroups package for
GAP](https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups), and it
is possible to use `libsemigroups` directly in Python 3 via the package
[libsemigroups_pybind11](https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups_pybind11/).
The development version of `libsemigroups` is available on
[github](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups), and some
related projects are [here](https://github.com/libsemigroups).

## Design principles

The main classes in `libsemigroups` are named after the algorithms they
implement; see, for example, [`libsemigroups::FroidurePin`][],
[`libsemigroups::Konieczny`][], [`libsemigroups::ToddCoxeter`][],
[`libsemigroups::Kambites`][], [`libsemigroups::KnuthBendix`][],
[`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`][], [`libsemigroups::Sims1`][], [`libsemigroups::Sims2`][],
or [`libsemigroups::Stephen`][].

`libsemigroups` is a modern open source C++ library designed to be:

- **state of the art**: the mathematical underpinnings of several of the
  algorithms in `libsemigroups` originate from the authors and contributors; and the
  other algorithms are adapted from the literature (see above for details);
- **extensible**: [`libsemigroups::FroidurePin`][], [`libsemigroups::Konieczny`][], and
  [`libsemigroups::SchreierSims`][] are generic and can be adapted to user-defined
  types;
- **adaptable**: the behaviour of many algorithms implementing in `libsemigroups`
  can be fine-tuned via many settings, and used interactively via the functions
  [`libsemigroups::Runner::run_for`][] and [`libsemigroups::Runner::run_until`][];
- **easy to use**: converting between different types of `libsemigroups`
  objects (see [the `to` function][]) is easy; there are many
  helper functions to streamline common tasks; high quality exception messages
  are implemented throughout the code base (although you don't have to use these
  if you don't want to); long running algorithms can provide detailed feedback on
  their progress (see [`libsemigroups::ReportGuard`][]); many data structures can be
  visualised using graphviz (see [`libsemigroups::Dot`][] and
  [Visualisation][]);
  and there are hundreds of examples in the [tests][] directory.
- **fast**: `libsemigroups` is designed with performance in mind; several
  classes implement parallel algorithms ([`libsemigroups::Sims1`][],
  [`libsemigroups::Sims2`][], [`libsemigroups::Congruence`][]);
  we provide some "winner takes all" mechanisms for running algorithms
  concurrently (see [`libsemigroups::Congruence`][]); there are
  `_no_checks` versions of most functions if performance is critical.
